# Secondary Transport - NewOrg Migration Plan

**Migration Date**: October 22, 2025
**Scenario**: Batch 1, Scenario #4
**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: HIGH

---

## Related Documentation

**This migration includes consolidated source documentation:**

1. **[SECONDARY_TRANSPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](source-docs/SECONDARY_TRANSPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Original Oct 7-8 implementation
2. **[TRANSPORT_CHARGE_ISSUES_CONSOLIDATED.md](source-docs/TRANSPORT_CHARGE_ISSUES_CONSOLIDATED.md)** - Oct 14-15 bug fixes

**Consolidation Rationale**: Both documents modify rlcsJobService.cls (41,558 lines) with sequential version updates (V1‚ÜíV2‚ÜíV3‚ÜíV4).

---

## Executive Summary

This migration deploys the **Secondary Transport** feature with critical bug fixes to NewOrg. Secondary Transport allows RLCS jobs to include additional transport charges that are separate from the primary job charge, enabling proper invoicing for multi-leg transportation.

**üö® CRITICAL FINDING**:
- **NewOrg currently has V3** (Oct 10, 12:59 UTC) which **contains bugs**
- **OldOrg has V4** (Oct 15, 14:09 UTC) which **fixes the bugs**
- **Gap**: 5 days of bug fixes missing from NewOrg
- **Impact**: NewOrg has known bugs in rlcsJobService.cls (map initialization, OrderItem query)

## Migration Plan

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Verify V4 code in OldOrg** - Confirm rlcsJobService.cls from OldOrg is V4 (Oct 15)
- [ ] **Backup NewOrg V3** - Retrieve current NewOrg version for rollback
- [ ] **Test Class Coverage** - Verify rlcsJobServiceTest.cls has 75%+ coverage
- [ ] **Identify Test Data** - Find test Job__c records with secondary transport charges
- [ ] **Communication** - Notify RLCS team of deployment window (potential downtime)
- [ ] **Rollback Plan** - Prepare to restore V3 if V4 deployment fails

### Phase 1: Code Retrieval (OldOrg V4) - 15 minutes

**Retrieve all 5 Apex classes** from OldOrg (already completed):

```bash
cd /home/john/Projects/Salesforce

# Retrieve V4 code
sf project retrieve start --target-org OldOrg \
  -m "ApexClass:rlcsJobService" \
  -m "ApexClass:rlcsJobServiceTest" \
  -m "ApexClass:RLCSChargeService" \
  -m "ApexClass:RLCSChargeServiceTest" \
  -m "ApexClass:rlcsJobTriggerHandler"
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify V4 timestamps match OldOrg
ls -la force-app/main/default/classes/rlcsJobService*
# Expect: Oct 15, 2025 timestamps
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Deployment Validation - 30 minutes

**2.1 Run All Tests in OldOrg** (verify V4 stability):
```bash
sf apex run test --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --class-names rlcsJobServiceTest,RLCSChargeServiceTest \
  --target-org OldOrg \
  --code-coverage \
  --result-format human \
  --wait 30
```

**Expected**: All tests pass with 75%+ coverage

**2.2 Validate Metadata** (check for dependencies):
```bash
sf project deploy validate \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunLocalTests \
  --wait 30
```

**2.3 Review V4 Changes** (code diff):
```bash
# Compare V3 vs V4 in rlcsJobService.cls
# Focus on: map initialization, OrderItem query, description logic
```

### Phase 3: Deployment (V4 to NewOrg) - 30 minutes

**3.1 Deploy Apex Classes** (with tests):
```bash
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir force-app/main/default/classes \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --class-names rlcsJobServiceTest,RLCSChargeServiceTest \
  --wait 30
```

**Monitor for**:
- All 5 classes deployed successfully
- rlcsJobServiceTest.cls runs (it's new to NewOrg)
- No test failures
- Code coverage remains above 75%

**3.2 Capture Deploy ID**:
```bash
# After successful deployment
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, CreatedDate, Status FROM DeployRequest WHERE CreatedDate >= TODAY ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 1" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```

**Record Deploy ID** for migration documentation.

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment Verification - 1 hour

**4.1 Verify Component Versions**:
```bash
# Confirm rlcsJobService.cls is now V4
sf data query --query "SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedBy.Name, LengthWithoutComments FROM ApexClass WHERE Name IN ('rlcsJobService', 'rlcsJobServiceTest') ORDER BY Name" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```

**Expected**:
- rlcsJobService: LastModifiedDate = deployment date (Oct 22, 2025)
- rlcsJobServiceTest: Exists in NewOrg
- LengthWithoutComments matches OldOrg V4

**4.2 Test Bug Fix #1 (Map Initialization)**:

**Scenario**: Create job with secondary transport charges
```bash
# Manual test via NewOrg UI
# 1. Create Quote with primary + secondary transport
# 2. Convert Quote to Job
# 3. Verify no NullPointerException errors
# 4. Check Debug Logs for map initialization
```

**Expected**: Job created successfully without map errors.

**4.3 Test Bug Fix #2 (OrderItem Query)**:

**Scenario**: Verify Job_Charge__c records linked to OrderItems
```bash
# Query NewOrg
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, Name, OrderItem__c, Secondary_Transport__c FROM Job_Charge__c WHERE Secondary_Transport__c = true ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 10" --target-org NewOrg

# Verify OrderItem__c is populated (not null)
```

**Expected**: All secondary transport charges have OrderItem__c populated.

**4.4 Test Bug Fix #3 (Description Fields)**:

**Scenario**: Verify Description__c and Internal_Description__c populated
```bash
# Query NewOrg
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, Name, Description__c, Internal_Description__c FROM Job_Charge__c WHERE Secondary_Transport__c = true ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 10" --target-org NewOrg

# Verify both description fields are not null and contain expected values
```

**Expected**: Description fields populated with transport details.

**4.5 Run Full Test Suite** (verify no regressions):
```bash
sf apex run test --test-level RunLocalTests \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --code-coverage \
  --result-format human \
  --wait 60
```

**Expected**: All tests pass, coverage above 75%.

### Phase 5: End-to-End Testing - 1 hour

**5.1 CSV Upload Test** (V2 columns 14-15):

**Test Data**:
```csv
Job__c,Charge_Type__c,Charge_Value__c,...,Transport_Type__c,Secondary_Transport__c
JOB-12345,Transport,250,...,Secondary,TRUE
```

**Steps**:
1. Upload CSV via NewOrg UI
2. Verify Job_Charge__c records created
3. Check Transport_Type__c = "Secondary"
4. Check Secondary_Transport__c = TRUE

**Expected**: CSV import succeeds with columns 14-15 populated.

**5.2 Primary + Secondary Transport Job** (end-to-end):

**Scenario**: Create complete job with both transport types

**Steps**:
1. Create Quote with:
   - Primary transport charge: ¬£500
   - Secondary transport charge: ¬£250
2. Convert Quote to Job
3. Verify Job_Charge__c records:
   - 1 record: Transport_Type__c = "Primary", Secondary_Transport__c = FALSE
   - 1 record: Transport_Type__c = "Secondary", Secondary_Transport__c = TRUE
4. Verify OrderItem creation and linking
5. Create Invoice
6. Verify both charges appear on invoice

**Expected**: Complete job lifecycle works with secondary transport.

**5.3 Regression Test** (existing functionality):

**Scenario**: Jobs without secondary transport still work

**Steps**:
1. Create Quote with only primary transport
2. Convert to Job
3. Verify Job_Charge__c created correctly (Secondary_Transport__c = FALSE)
4. Create Invoice
5. Verify invoice correct

**Expected**: No impact on jobs without secondary transport.

### Phase 6: Monitoring - 1 week

**6.1 Daily Checks** (first 3 days):
```bash
# Check for errors in debug logs
sf apex tail log --target-org NewOrg

# Query recent Job_Charge__c records
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, Name, Secondary_Transport__c, OrderItem__c, Description__c, CreatedDate FROM Job_Charge__c WHERE CreatedDate >= YESTERDAY ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 50" --target-org NewOrg

# Verify no spike in errors
```

**Monitor for**:
- NullPointerException errors (Bug #1)
- SOQL errors related to OrderItem (Bug #2)
- Empty Description__c fields (Bug #3)

**6.2 Weekly Report** (after 1 week):
- Total Job_Charge__c records created with Secondary_Transport__c = TRUE
- Success rate (records with OrderItem__c populated / total)
- User feedback from RLCS team
- Any edge cases or new issues discovered

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Scenario 1: Deployment Fails (Tests Fail)

**Symptoms**: Deployment validation fails, tests don't pass

**Action**:
1. **DO NOT PROCEED** with deployment
2. Review test failures in deployment log
3. Compare V4 code with V3 to identify conflicts
4. Fix issues in OldOrg first, then re-attempt deployment

**Impact**: Low - NewOrg still has V3 (with bugs, but functional)

### Scenario 2: Deployment Succeeds, But Bugs in Production

**Symptoms**: Deployment completes, but V4 introduces new issues

**Action**:
1. **Retrieve V3 code** from backup (pre-migration):
   ```bash
   # Use backup from pre-migration retrieval
   cd /home/john/Projects/Salesforce/Backup/2025-10-22_secondary_transport_v3

   sf project deploy start \
     --source-dir classes/ \
     --target-org NewOrg \
     --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
     --class-names rlcsJobServiceTest,RLCSChargeServiceTest
   ```

2. **Verify rollback**:
   ```bash
   sf data query --query "SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate FROM ApexClass WHERE Name = 'rlcsJobService'" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
   # Expect: LastModifiedDate = Oct 10, 2025 (V3 restored)
   ```

3. **Communicate** to RLCS team that V4 was rolled back

**Impact**: Medium - Reverts to V3 with known bugs, but those bugs were present before migration

### Scenario 3: Partial Functionality Loss

**Symptoms**: Some V4 features work, others broken

**Action**:
1. **Identify broken functionality** via debug logs
2. **Compare with OldOrg V4** - Is same functionality broken there?
   - **If YES**: Issue exists in V4, needs new fix
   - **If NO**: NewOrg environment-specific issue
3. **Temporary mitigation**: Disable CSV upload (if that's the broken feature)
4. **Long-term fix**: Create V5 with fix, deploy to OldOrg first, then NewOrg

**Impact**: High - Users blocked on specific features

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Test Class Coverage Below 75%

**Probability**: LOW (OldOrg tests pass with 75%+)
**Impact**: HIGH (deployment will fail)

**Mitigation**:
- Run pre-deployment validation (Phase 2.1) to confirm coverage BEFORE deployment
- If coverage low, add test methods to rlcsJobServiceTest.cls
- Deploy test class updates separately, then deploy main classes

### Risk 2: V4 Introduces New Bugs (Unknown)

**Probability**: MEDIUM (V4 has 5 days of production use in OldOrg, but NewOrg environment may differ)
**Impact**: HIGH (breaks secondary transport functionality)

**Mitigation**:
- Thorough testing in Phase 4 and Phase 5
- Monitor debug logs for 24 hours post-deployment (Phase 6.1)
- Have rollback plan ready (restore V3 if critical bug found)
- Deploy during low-usage period (weekend or evening)

### Risk 3: NewOrg Environment Differences

**Probability**: LOW (NewOrg and OldOrg are similar sandboxes)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (some V4 features may not work due to config differences)

**Mitigation**:
- Compare custom settings between OldOrg and NewOrg before deployment
- Verify Job_Charge__c object fields exist in NewOrg (Description__c, Internal_Description__c from V3)
- Test in NewOrg sandbox first if possible, then production

### Risk 4: Missing Test Class (rlcsJobServiceTest.cls)

**Probability**: CONFIRMED (test class not in NewOrg)
**Impact**: HIGH (cannot deploy rlcsJobService.cls without tests)

**Mitigation**:
- Deploy rlcsJobServiceTest.cls FIRST in Phase 3.1
- Verify test class compiles before deploying main class
- If test class deployment fails, investigate dependencies and fix before proceeding

### Risk 5: User Confusion (V3 Bugs Still Present Until Deployment)

**Probability**: CONFIRMED (V3 bugs present in NewOrg until V4 deployed)
**Impact**: MEDIUM (users experience known bugs until V4 deployed)

**Mitigation**:
- Communicate to RLCS team that bugs exist and will be fixed in deployment
- Provide workarounds for known bugs (e.g., manual OrderItem linking)
- Prioritize deployment to minimize time users experience bugs

## Appendix

### A. Deploy IDs Reference

**OldOrg Deploy IDs**:
- **V1** (Oct 7, 2025 20:10 UTC): 0AfSj000000yDbtKAE
- **V2** (Oct 8, 2025 17:02 UTC): 0AfSj000000yGbNKAU
- **V3** (Oct 10, 2025 09:24 UTC): 0AfSj000000yVDpKAM (bugs introduced)
- **V4** (Oct 15, 2025 14:09 UTC): 0AfSj000000yp2rKAA (bugs fixed)

**NewOrg Deploy IDs**:
- **V3** (Oct 10, 2025 12:59 UTC): 0AfSq000003iMYHKA2 (CURRENT - with bugs)
- **V4** (Oct 22, 2025 [TBD]): [TO BE RECORDED DURING PHASE 3.2]

### B. Useful Queries

**Check current version in NewOrg**:
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedBy.Name FROM ApexClass WHERE Name IN ('rlcsJobService', 'rlcsJobServiceTest', 'RLCSChargeService') ORDER BY Name" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```

**Find recent Job_Charge__c records with secondary transport**:
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT Id, Name, Job__r.Name, Secondary_Transport__c, Transport_Type__c, Description__c, OrderItem__c, CreatedDate FROM Job_Charge__c WHERE Secondary_Transport__c = true ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC LIMIT 50" --target-org NewOrg
```

**Check for NullPointerException errors**:
```bash
sf apex tail log --target-org NewOrg --color

# Look for: "System.NullPointerException"
```

**Count deployments in date range**:
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT COUNT(Id), Status FROM DeployRequest WHERE CreatedDate >= 2025-10-07T00:00:00Z AND CreatedDate <= 2025-10-15T23:59:59Z GROUP BY Status" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```

### C. Code Diff Commands

**Compare V3 vs V4** (rlcsJobService.cls):
```bash
# Retrieve V3 from NewOrg (backup)
cd /home/john/Projects/Salesforce/Backup/2025-10-22_secondary_transport_v3
sf project retrieve start --target-org NewOrg -m "ApexClass:rlcsJobService"

# Compare with V4 from OldOrg
cd /home/john/Projects/Salesforce
diff -u Backup/2025-10-22_secondary_transport_v3/force-app/main/default/classes/rlcsJobService.cls \
  force-app/main/default/classes/rlcsJobService.cls
```

**Key Differences to Look For**:
- Map initialization in createJobFromQuote() method
- OrderItem SOQL query field list
- Description__c and Internal_Description__c assignment logic

### D. Glossary

- **V1**: Initial secondary transport implementation (Oct 7, 2025)
- **V2**: CSV upload fix for columns 14-15 (Oct 8, 2025)
- **V3**: Description fields added (Oct 10, 2025) - **BUGS INTRODUCED**
- **V4**: Bug fixes (Oct 15, 2025) - **STABLE VERSION**
