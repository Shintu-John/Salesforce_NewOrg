## Pre-Test Verification Checklist

**Before running functional tests, verify**:

- [x] ✅ Custom Setting `Case_Auto_Assignment_Settings__c` configured with org default
- [x] ✅ Custom Setting value: `Max_Open_Cases_Per_User__c = 20`
- [x] ⚠️ At least 2 active Customer Service users exist - **ONLY 1 FOUND** (Kaylie Morris)
- [x] ✅ Customer Service Email queue exists and has members (ID: 00GSq000003BmxFMAS)
- [x] ✅ Email Record Type exists on Case object (ID: 012d3000000BUE5AAO)
- [x] ✅ Flow `Case_Remove_Case_Owner_if_Reopen_24_Hours` is **ACTIVE** (assumed, manually activated)
- [x] ✅ Field-Level Security set for `Previous_Auto_Assigned_Owner__c`
- [x] ✅ Test execution scheduled during low-activity period (21:46 BST)

**🚨 CRITICAL PRE-TEST FINDING**:
- Only 1 Customer Service user found (Kaylie Morris)
- User's `LastLoginDate` is older than 30 days
- **Impact**: User filtered out by eligibility criteria, 0 eligible users for assignment

## Test Results

### Test 1: Basic Assignment

**Objective**: Create case and verify it gets assigned to a Customer Service user

**Steps**:
1. Create case with Email Record Type
2. Assign to Customer Service Email queue
3. Trigger assignment logic
4. Verify case owner changed to a User

**Expected Result**:
- Case owner changes from Queue to User
- `rlsServiceCaseAutoAssign_Date_Time__c` field populated
- Assignment occurs within 2-3 seconds

**Actual Result**:
- ❌ Case remained in Customer Service Email queue
- Case Number: 00325191
- Case ID: 500Sq00000cdos3IAA
- `rlsServiceCaseAutoAssign_Date_Time__c`: null (not populated)
- Owner: Customer Service Email (Queue)
- Owner Type: Queue (expected: User)

**Status**: [x] ❌ FAILED

**Root Cause**:
- Apex debug log: "Found 0 eligible users for case assignment."
- Kaylie Morris filtered out by `LastLoginDate >= :today` (30-day requirement)
- No eligible users = no assignment

**Debug Log Extract**:
```
Cached Email Record Type ID: 012d3000000BUE5AAO
Cached CS Email Queue ID: 00GSq000003BmxFMAS
Retrieved threshold from custom setting: 20
Found 0 eligible users for case assignment.
No eligible users found for case assignment.
```

**Notes**: Test revealed production readiness blocker. System is functionally correct but cannot operate until CS users log in.

### Test 2: Workload Distribution

**Objective**: Create 5 cases and verify even distribution across users

**Steps**:
1. Create 5 cases assigned to queue
2. Trigger assignment for all cases
3. Verify cases distributed across multiple users
4. Verify no single user receives all cases

**Expected Result**:
- All 5 cases assigned to users (not queue)
- Cases distributed across 2+ users if available
- Users with lowest open case count receive priority

**Actual Result**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Distribution**:
| User Name | Cases Assigned |
|-----------|----------------|
| [User 1]  | [Count]        |
| [User 2]  | [Count]        |
| [User 3]  | [Count]        |

**Status**: [ ] ✅ PASSED | [ ] ❌ FAILED | [ ] ⚠️ WARNING

**Notes**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

---

### Test 3: Previous Owner Reassignment (Same Day)

**Objective**: Verify same-day previous owner reassignment logic

**Steps**:
1. Create case assigned to specific user
2. Move case to queue
3. Set `Previous_Auto_Assigned_Owner__c` = that user
4. Set `Most_Recent_Message__c` = TODAY
5. Trigger assignment
6. Verify case returns to previous owner (if under threshold)

**Expected Result**:
- Case reassigned to previous owner IF:
  - Previous owner is under max case threshold
  - Most Recent Message is same day
  - Previous owner is still eligible (active, not excluded)
- If previous owner over threshold, case assigned to next available user

**Actual Result**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Status**: [ ] ✅ PASSED | [ ] ❌ FAILED | [ ] ⚠️ WARNING

**Notes**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

---

### Test 4: User Exclusion Flag

**Objective**: Verify users with exclusion flag are not assigned cases

**Steps**:
1. Set `Dont_Auto_Assign_Cases__c = true` for one Customer Service user
2. Create case assigned to queue
3. Trigger assignment
4. Verify excluded user did NOT receive the case
5. Reset exclusion flag

**Expected Result**:
- Excluded user is not assigned any cases
- Case assigned to different eligible user

**Actual Result**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Status**: [ ] ✅ PASSED | [ ] ❌ FAILED | [ ] ⚠️ WARNING

**Notes**: [TO BE COMPLETED]

## Additional Manual Testing

### Test 5: Flow Activation (Case Reopening)

**Objective**: Verify Flow triggers on case reopening after 14+ hours

**Important**: Flow file name says "24_Hours" but actual threshold in logic is **14 hours**

**Steps** (Manual UI test):
1. Create Email case assigned to a user
2. Close the case (Status = Closed)
3. Wait 14+ hours OR modify case date fields for testing (Most_Recent_Message__c and Previous_Email_Time__c)
4. Reopen the case (Status = Reopened)
5. Verify Flow triggers:
   - Case owner changes to Customer Service Email queue
   - `Previous_Auto_Assigned_Owner__c` field populated
   - Assignment logic automatically reassigns case

**Expected Result**: [TO BE COMPLETED AFTER 14+ HOURS]

**Actual Result**: [TO BE COMPLETED AFTER 14+ HOURS]

**Status**: [ ] ✅ PASSED | [ ] ❌ FAILED | [ ] ⚠️ WARNING | [ ] ⏳ PENDING

**Notes**: This test requires 14+ hour wait period or date manipulation. Flow compares (Most_Recent_Message__c - Previous_Email_Time__c) * 24 > 14
