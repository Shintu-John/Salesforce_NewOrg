## Manual Functional Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Invoice Creation with PDF Attachment

**Test ID:** FT-10-001
**Priority:** High
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING MANUAL TESTING

**Objective:**
Verify that creating an Invoice with a PDF attachment automatically creates a ContentDistribution record for portal access.

**Prerequisites:**
- User has Create permission on Invoice__c
- User has Create permission on ContentVersion
- InvoiceTrigger is Active
- System Administrator profile

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in to Salesforce NewOrg as System Administrator
2. Navigate to Invoice__c tab
3. Click "New Invoice"
4. Fill in required fields:
   - Account__c: Select any Account
   - (Other required fields as per page layout)
5. Save the Invoice record
6. Note the Invoice Id
7. Click "Related" tab
8. Click "Files" → "Upload Files"
9. Upload a sample PDF file (e.g., "Invoice_12345.pdf")
10. Wait for upload to complete
11. Open Developer Console
12. Execute Anonymous Apex:
```apex
Invoice__c invoice = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Invoice__c WHERE Id = '<INVOICE_ID>' LIMIT 1];
List<ContentDocumentLink> cdLinks = [
    SELECT ContentDocument.LatestPublishedVersionId, ContentDocument.Title
    FROM ContentDocumentLink
    WHERE LinkedEntityId = :invoice.Id
];
List<ContentDistribution> distributions = [
    SELECT Id, Name, DistributionPublicUrl, PreferencesAllowViewInBrowser
    FROM ContentDistribution
    WHERE ContentVersionId = :cdLinks[0].ContentDocument.LatestPublishedVersionId
];
System.debug('Invoice: ' + invoice);
System.debug('ContentDistributions: ' + distributions);
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Invoice record created successfully
- ✅ PDF file uploaded and linked to Invoice
- ✅ InvoiceTrigger fires (after insert)
- ✅ ContentDistribution record created
- ✅ ContentDistribution.Name matches PDF title
- ✅ ContentDistribution.DistributionPublicUrl is populated
- ✅ ContentDistribution.PreferencesAllowViewInBrowser = true

### Test Case 2: Invoice Update - Adding PDF After Creation

**Test ID:** FT-10-002
**Priority:** High
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING MANUAL TESTING

**Objective:**
Verify that adding a PDF to an existing Invoice (without PDF) creates ContentDistribution on update.

**Prerequisites:**
- Test Case 1 prerequisites
- Existing Invoice without PDF attachment

**Test Steps:**
1. Create Invoice without PDF (follow Test Case 1 steps 1-6)
2. Verify no ContentDocumentLink exists:
```apex
List<ContentDocumentLink> cdLinks = [
    SELECT Id FROM ContentDocumentLink WHERE LinkedEntityId = '<INVOICE_ID>'
];
System.assertEquals(0, cdLinks.size(), 'Should have no files initially');
```
3. Upload PDF to Invoice (follow Test Case 1 steps 7-9)
4. Query ContentDistribution:
```apex
List<ContentDistribution> distributions = [
    SELECT Id FROM ContentDistribution
    WHERE ContentVersionId IN (
        SELECT ContentDocument.LatestPublishedVersionId
        FROM ContentDocumentLink
        WHERE LinkedEntityId = '<INVOICE_ID>'
    )
];
System.debug('ContentDistributions: ' + distributions);
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Invoice created without PDF
- ✅ No ContentDistribution initially
- ✅ PDF uploaded successfully
- ✅ InvoiceTrigger fires (after update)
- ✅ ContentDistribution created after PDF upload
- ✅ Only ONE ContentDistribution per PDF

**Actual Results:**
- [ ] Test Not Yet Executed

**Pass/Fail:** ⚠️ PENDING

**Notes:**

### Test Case 3: Duplicate ContentDistribution Prevention

**Test ID:** FT-10-003
**Priority:** High
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING MANUAL TESTING

**Objective:**
Verify that multiple updates to an Invoice with the same PDF do not create duplicate ContentDistribution records.

**Prerequisites:**
- Test Case 1 or 2 completed successfully
- Invoice with PDF and ContentDistribution

**Test Steps:**
1. Query initial ContentDistribution count:
```apex
Integer initialCount = [
    SELECT COUNT()
    FROM ContentDistribution
    WHERE ContentVersionId IN (
        SELECT ContentDocument.LatestPublishedVersionId
        FROM ContentDocumentLink
        WHERE LinkedEntityId = '<INVOICE_ID>'
    )
];
System.debug('Initial ContentDistribution count: ' + initialCount);
```
2. Edit Invoice record (change any field, e.g., Description)
3. Save Invoice
4. Wait 5 seconds for trigger to complete
5. Query ContentDistribution count again:
```apex
Integer afterUpdateCount = [
    SELECT COUNT()
    FROM ContentDistribution
    WHERE ContentVersionId IN (
        SELECT ContentDocument.LatestPublishedVersionId
        FROM ContentDocumentLink
        WHERE LinkedEntityId = '<INVOICE_ID>'
    )
];
System.debug('After update ContentDistribution count: ' + afterUpdateCount);
System.assertEquals(initialCount, afterUpdateCount, 'Should not create duplicates');
```
6. Repeat steps 2-5 multiple times (3-5 iterations)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Initial ContentDistribution count = 1
- ✅ After each update, count remains = 1
- ✅ No duplicate ContentDistribution records created
- ✅ ContentDistributionHelper checks for existing distribution before creating

**Actual Results:**
- [ ] Test Not Yet Executed
