# Scenario 10: Invoice Email Portal Access

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED - Manual Configuration Pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Deployment Date:** October 29, 2025
**Deploy ID:** 0AfSq000003pQhvKAE

---

## Overview

This scenario implements automated ContentDistribution creation for invoice PDFs, enabling customer portal users to access invoices through the InvoiceFileList Visualforce page. When invoices are created or updated with PDF attachments, the system automatically creates ContentDistribution records that provide public URLs for portal access.

**Business Value:**
- Automated invoice PDF distribution to customer portal
- No manual sharing or email distribution required
- Secure, tracked access to invoice files
- Improved customer self-service capabilities

## How It Works

### Invoice ContentDistribution Flow

```
1. User creates/updates Invoice__c record
2. User attaches PDF file to Invoice
3. InvoiceTrigger fires (after insert/update)
4. InvoiceTriggerHandler.afterInsert/afterUpdate() called
5. ContentDistributionHelper.manageInvoiceContentDistribution() invoked
6. System queries ContentDocumentLinks for PDF files
7. System checks for existing ContentDistribution records
8. Creates ContentDistribution for new PDFs (prevents duplicates)
9. ContentDistribution provides public URL for portal access
10. Portal user navigates to InvoiceFileList page
11. InvoiceFileListController retrieves invoices + ContentDistribution URLs
12. User clicks PDF link → PDF opens/downloads via ContentDistribution URL
```

### Job Paperwork ContentDistribution Flow (Existing)

```
1. Job__c record has Required_Paperwork__c = 'ADOC' or 'WTN'
2. User uploads ADOC/WTN files with Document__c field set
3. Job updated with DOC_uploaded__c or Waste_Transfer_Note_Uploaded__c = true
4. Job trigger fires (not part of this deployment)
5. ContentDistributionHelper.manageContentDistribution(jobMap) called
6. System creates ContentDistribution for ADOC and WTN
7. Job__c fields populated:
   - DOC_ContentDistribution_Id__c
   - WTN_ContentDistribution_Id__c
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Issue 1: Manual Configuration Required
**Severity:** High
**Description:** FLS, Page Layouts, and Portal configuration must be done manually
**Impact:** Portal users cannot access invoices until configuration complete
**Workaround:** Complete configuration steps outlined above
**Status:** ⚠️ Pending

### Issue 2: ContentDistribution URL Expiration
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** ContentDistribution URLs may expire based on Salesforce org settings
**Impact:** Users may need to refresh page to get new URLs
**Workaround:** System auto-creates new ContentDistribution if needed
**Status:** ⚠️ Monitor

### Issue 3: Portal User Permissions
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Portal users need specific object and field permissions
**Impact:** Users may see "Insufficient Privileges" errors
**Workaround:** Ensure Customer Community profiles have proper FLS
**Status:** ⚠️ Configuration Required

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered:

### Step 1: Deactivate Trigger
```bash
# Option A: Set trigger to Inactive
sf project retrieve start -m ApexTrigger:InvoiceTrigger --target-org NewOrg
# Edit trigger status to Inactive
sf project deploy start -d triggers/ --target-org NewOrg

# Option B: Comment out handler calls
# Edit InvoiceTrigger.trigger and comment lines calling InvoiceTriggerHandler
```

### Step 2: Remove Portal Access
1. Setup → Digital Experiences → All Sites
2. Remove InvoiceFileList from site pages
3. Update Customer Community profile to remove Visualforce page access

### Step 3: Monitor
- Check Debug Logs for 24 hours
- Review Cases for customer-reported issues
- Monitor ContentDistribution creation volume

### Step 4: Re-deploy Fix
- Fix identified issues
- Deploy updated code
- Re-enable trigger
- Re-add portal access

- **Solution:** Check portal user's Account has invoices, verify SOQL query in controller

**Issue:** Duplicate ContentDistribution records created
- **Solution:** Check ContentDistributionHelper duplicate prevention logic, review trigger execution order

### Debug Steps

1. Enable Debug Logs for running user
2. Set all log levels to FINEST
3. Reproduce issue
4. Review Debug Log for:
   - Trigger execution
   - SOQL queries
   - DML operations
   - Exceptions or errors
