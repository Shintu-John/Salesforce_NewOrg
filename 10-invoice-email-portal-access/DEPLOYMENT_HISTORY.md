## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
**Time:** 09:00-09:15 (15 minutes)

- Reviewed scenario 10 requirements
- Identified components to deploy from OldOrg
- Confirmed no triggers require activation approval (trigger already exists)

### Step 2: Component Retrieval
**Time:** 09:15-09:20 (5 minutes)

Components retrieved from NewOrg (already deployed in earlier session):
- InvoiceTrigger and InvoiceTriggerHandler
- ContentDistributionHelper and ContentDistributionHelperTest
- InvoiceFileListController, InvoiceFileListControllerTest, InvoiceFileList page

### Step 3: Initial Deployment Attempt
**Time:** 09:20-09:45 (25 minutes)
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
sf project deploy start -d code --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests InvoiceTriggerTest \
  --tests ContentDistributionHelperTest \
  --tests InvoiceFileListControllerTest
```

**Error:** InvoiceTriggerTest failures
- `comp_house__Company_Number__c` required on Account (NewOrg validation rule)
- Job_Charge__c records not auto-created in NewOrg
- `Description__c` required on Job_Charge__c (NewOrg validation rule)

### Step 4: Test Fix - InvoiceTriggerTest (Round 1)
**Time:** 09:45-10:00 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Company Number validation

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Line 62: Added Company Number for NewOrg validation
accountRec.comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678';  // Required in NewOrg
```

**Result:** ❌ Still failing - List index out of bounds

### Step 5: Test Fix - InvoiceTriggerTest (Round 2)
**Time:** 10:00-10:15 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Job_Charge__c records not auto-created

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Lines 91-97: Explicitly created Job_Charge__c with required fields
Job_Charge__c charge = new Job_Charge__c();
charge.Job__c = job.Id;
charge.Cost__c = 100;
charge.Sales_Price__c = 150;
charge.Description__c = 'Test Job Charge';  // Required in NewOrg
insert charge;
```

**Result:** ❌ Still failing - Description validation

### Step 6: Test Fix - InvoiceTriggerTest (Round 3)
**Time:** 10:15-10:30 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Description__c required on Job_Charge__c

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
charge.Description__c = 'Test Job Charge';  // Required in NewOrg
```

**Result:** ✅ InvoiceTriggerTest now passes with 100% coverage

### Step 7: Coverage Issue - Deployment Failed
**Time:** 10:30-10:45 (15 minutes)
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Error:** Insufficient code coverage
- ContentDistributionHelper: 7% (needs 75%)
- InvoiceFileListController: 0% (needs 75%)

**Root Cause:** Need to run ALL test classes together, not just InvoiceTriggerTest

### Step 8: Test Fix - ContentDistributionHelperTest (Round 1)
**Time:** 10:45-11:00 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Same validation rule failures in ContentDistributionHelperTest

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
sf project deploy start \
  -d code/classes/ContentDistributionHelperTest.cls \
  -d code/classes/ContentDistributionHelperTest.cls-meta.xml \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ContentDistributionHelperTest
```

**Error:** Line 6 - comp_house__Company_Number__c required

### Step 9: Test Fix - ContentDistributionHelperTest (Round 2)
**Time:** 11:00-11:15 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Multiple Account creation points missing Company Number

**Fixes Applied:**
```apex
// Line 6 fix (actually line 19 in code)
Account supplier = TestFactory.createSupplier('Vendor 1');
supplier.comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678';  // Required in NewOrg
insert supplier;

// Line 98 fix
Account acc = new Account(Name='Test Account');
acc.comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678';  // Required in NewOrg
insert acc;
```

**Result:** ❌ Still failing - line 6 (first test method)

### Step 10: Test Fix - ContentDistributionHelperTest (Round 3)
**Time:** 11:15-11:30 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** First test method also has Account at line 5-6

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Lines 5-6 fix
Account acc = new Account(Name='Test Account');
acc.comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678';  // Required in NewOrg
Insert acc;
```

**Result:** ✅ ContentDistributionHelperTest now passes both methods

### Step 11: Test Fix - InvoiceFileListControllerTest
**Time:** 11:30-11:40 (10 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
sf project deploy start \
  -d code/classes/InvoiceFileListControllerTest.cls \
  -d code/classes/InvoiceFileListControllerTest.cls-meta.xml \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests InvoiceFileListControllerTest
```

**Result:** Test passed without modifications (already uses TestFactory properly)

### Step 12: Full Coverage Deployment - Failed
**Time:** 11:40-11:55 (15 minutes)
**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
sf project deploy start -d code --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests InvoiceTriggerTest \
  --tests ContentDistributionHelperTest \
  --tests InvoiceFileListControllerTest
```

**Error:** ContentDistributionHelper only 8% coverage
**Root Cause:** testContentDistributionHelper method creates test data but never calls ContentDistributionHelper.manageContentDistribution()

### Step 13: Test Fix - ContentDistributionHelperTest Coverage
**Time:** 11:55-12:10 (15 minutes)
**Issue:** Test method incomplete - doesn't call the helper method

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Added lines 96-107
// Call the ContentDistributionHelper to create distributions for job paperwork
Test.startTest();
ContentDistributionHelper.manageContentDistribution(jobMap);
Test.stopTest();

// Verify ContentDistribution records were created
List<ContentDistribution> distributions = [
    SELECT Id, Name, RelatedRecordId
    FROM ContentDistribution
    WHERE RelatedRecordId IN :jobMap.keySet()
];
System.assert(distributions.size() > 0, 'Should create ContentDistribution records for job paperwork');
```

**Result:** ✅ Test now achieves full coverage for manageContentDistribution method

### Step 14: Final Deployment - Success
**Time:** 12:10-12:25 (15 minutes)
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

**Deploy Command:**
```bash
sf project deploy start -d code --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests InvoiceTriggerTest \
  --tests ContentDistributionHelperTest \
  --tests InvoiceFileListControllerTest
```

**Results:**
- Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003pQhvKAE
- Status: SUCCESS
- Tests Passed: 6/6 (100%)
- Code Coverage:
  - ContentDistributionHelper: 98.8% (82/83 lines)
  - InvoiceFileListController: 85.3% (128/150 lines)
  - InvoiceTrigger: 100% (6/6 lines)
  - InvoiceTriggerHandler: 100% (29/29 lines)

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Issue 1: ContentDistributionHelper Line 84 Not Covered
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** One line (84) in ContentDistributionHelper not covered by tests (98.8% coverage)
**Impact:** None - line is a return statement for null/empty input
**Resolution:** Not required - 98.8% exceeds 75% threshold

### Issue 2: InvoiceFileListController 85.3% Coverage
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Some error handling paths not covered in InvoiceFileListControllerTest
**Impact:** None - 85.3% exceeds 75% threshold
**Resolution:** Could improve with additional edge case tests, but not required for deployment

### Issue 3: Manual Configuration Required
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** FLS, Page Layouts, and Portal configuration must be done manually
**Impact:** Portal users cannot access invoices until manual configuration complete
**Resolution:** Complete post-deployment configuration steps outlined above

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered post-deployment, follow these rollback steps:

### Step 1: Deactivate Trigger
```bash
# Retrieve trigger from NewOrg
sf project retrieve start -m ApexTrigger:InvoiceTrigger --target-org NewOrg

# Edit trigger to comment out handler calls
# Deploy as Inactive or with commented handler calls
sf project deploy start -d triggers/InvoiceTrigger.trigger --target-org NewOrg
```

### Step 2: Remove Portal Page Access
1. Navigate to Setup → Digital Experiences → All Sites
2. Remove InvoiceFileList page from portal navigation
3. Update portal user permissions to remove Visualforce page access

### Step 3: Delete ContentDistribution Records (Optional)
```sql
DELETE [SELECT Id FROM ContentDistribution WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY];
```

### Step 4: Monitor for Issues
- Check Debug Logs for trigger errors
- Monitor portal user login errors
- Review Case object for customer-reported issues

## Lessons Learned

### 1. NewOrg Has Additional Validation Rules
**Impact:** Required 3 rounds of test fixes for InvoiceTriggerTest, 3 rounds for ContentDistributionHelperTest
**Solution:** Always compare OldOrg vs NewOrg validation rules before deployment
**Prevention:** Add validation rule check to DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md pre-deployment steps

### 2. Incomplete Test Methods
**Impact:** ContentDistributionHelperTest had test data setup but didn't call the helper method
**Solution:** Review test methods to ensure they actually invoke the code being tested
**Prevention:** Add code coverage verification step before full deployment

### 3. Test Classes Must Cover All Code Paths
**Impact:** Initial deployment with just InvoiceTriggerTest showed 100% coverage for trigger/handler but 0% for helper
**Solution:** Run ALL test classes together in deployment to get accurate coverage picture
**Prevention:** Always use RunSpecifiedTests with ALL related test classes

### 4. Job_Charge__c Auto-Creation Differences
**Impact:** OldOrg auto-creates Job_Charge__c via triggers, NewOrg does not
**Solution:** Explicitly create Job_Charge__c in tests for NewOrg
**Prevention:** Document object relationship differences between OldOrg and NewOrg
