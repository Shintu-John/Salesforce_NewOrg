## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Helper Classes & Test Fixes (Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003njYXKAY)
**Duration:** 1 hour 30 minutes
**Challenges:** 9 failing tests (45% failure rate)
**Resolution:** Systematically identified and fixed all root causes

**Test Fixes Applied:**
1. Added Contract.Obligation_Type__c = 'Non-Household'
2. Changed POM RecordType from 'Household' to 'Non_Household'
3. Added all 30 categories (15 Household + 15 NonHousehold)
4. Added Acknowledgement_of_Statements__c = true
5. Implemented deduplication checks (delete before insert)
6. Changed to one-at-a-time insert to avoid Flow conflicts
7. Used different test data for each test class
8. Removed redundant createQuarterlyPOMRecords() calls
9. Optimized for governor limits

**Result:** 20/20 tests passing, 100% coverage

### Phase 2: Sharing Triggers (Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003njn3KAA)

**Resolution:**
1. Identified missing Status__c picklist values
2. Created field metadata with all 6 values
3. Fixed flow validation error (empty update element)
4. Added default status action

**Components:**
- Status__c field (6 picklist values)
- Producer_POM_Acknowledge_Feedback flow
- Producer_POM_Update_Status flow

**Result:** Both flows active and functional
