# Comparison: My Analysis vs Existing Documentation

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Analysis By**: John Shintu

## Summary

The existing documentation (NEWORG_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md and NEWORG_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) is ACCURATE but **INCOMPLETE**. It was created before the Oct 28 zero values fixes (Phases 8-9) were deployed to OldOrg.

---

## What Existing Documentation Covers ✅

### 1. Missing ProducerPomAcknowledgeController
- ✅ Correctly identified as MISSING in NewOrg
- ✅ Correctly identifies it as P0 CRITICAL  
- ✅ Has exact deployment command
- ✅ Updated Oct 28 in OldOrg (3,304 chars)

### 2. Show_Signature_Popup__c Formula Fix
- ✅ Correctly identifies formula uses wrong field in NewOrg
- ✅ OldOrg: Uses `$Profile.Name` (correct)
- ✅ NewOrg: Uses `$User.Profile_Name__c` (wrong)
- ✅ Has deployment command

### 3. Inactive Triggers (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Correctly identifies ALL 4 sharing triggers as INACTIVE
- ✅ Correctly identifies this as P0 BLOCKING
- ✅ Has manual activation steps with verification query
- ✅ Lists all 4 triggers:
  - ProducerContractSharingTrigger
  - ProducerObligationSharingTrigger
  - ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger
  - UserSharingBackfill

### 4. Rollup Triggers
- ✅ Correctly notes Rollup_ProducerContractTrigger is Inactive
- ✅ Correctly notes Rollup_ProducerPlacedOnMarketTrigger is Inactive
- ✅ Correctly marks as "Not critical for portal" (correct - these are for reporting)

### 5. Test Classes
- ✅ Correctly identifies test length differences
- ✅ ProducerSharingHelperTest: 11,647 (OldOrg) vs 13,428 (NewOrg) - NewOrg is newer
- ✅ UserSharingBackfillHelperTest: 6,919 (OldOrg) vs 9,447 (NewOrg) - NewOrg is newer
- ✅ Correctly assesses these as OK (enhanced tests in NewOrg)

### 6. SignatureLwcHelper
- ✅ Correctly notes it was deployed Oct 27 to both orgs
- ✅ Has verification command to check for Is_Record_Signed__c fix

## What Existing Documentation MISSES ❌

### 1. Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c Field Fix (Phase 8 - Oct 28)
**Status**: ❌ NOT MENTIONED in existing docs

**Details**:
- Fixed in OldOrg: Oct 28, 2025 (11:19 AM)
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zNu9KAE
- Change: ISBLANK() → ISNULL() for all 30 category fields
- Purpose: Allow zero values for quarterly reports
- NewOrg Status: Still has old version (Oct 9)

**Why Missing**: This fix was done AFTER the checklist was created (Oct 28 morning).

### 2. Placed_on_Market_Next_Best_Action_Mark_Weights_as_Entered Flow Fix (Phase 9 - Oct 28)
**Status**: ❌ NOT MENTIONED in existing docs

**Details**:
- Fixed in OldOrg: Oct 28, 2025 (11:23 AM)  
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zO5RKAU
- Change: Removed > 0 conditions, simplified flow logic
- Purpose: Set Weights_Entered__c = true for any save (including all zeros)
- NewOrg Status: Has old flow logic

**Why Missing**: This fix was done AFTER the checklist was created.

### 3. AutoCreateProducerObligationChargeTest Class
**Status**: ❌ NOT MENTIONED in existing docs

**Details**:
- Present in OldOrg: Yes (Last Modified: Sep 15, 2025)
- Present in NewOrg: No (MISSING)
- Impact: Low - not directly related to portal functionality
- Note: Parent class AutoCreateProducerObligationChargeBatch exists in NewOrg

### 4. SharingHelper Class
**Status**: ❌ NOT MENTIONED in existing docs

**Details**:
- Present in OldOrg: Yes (Last Modified: Aug 8, 2018)
- Present in NewOrg: No (MISSING)
- Impact: Unknown - very old utility class, likely not used
- Recommendation: Investigate if still referenced before deploying

## Updated Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Deploy ProducerPomAcknowledgeController (As Documented)
✅ Existing checklist is correct - follow as-is

### Phase 2: Deploy Field Fixes (EXPANDED - includes zero values fix)
❌ Existing checklist deploys entire objects directory (262 components)
✅ Better approach: Deploy specific fields

**Recommended Update**:
```bash
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir code/main/default/objects/Producer_Placed_on_Market__c/fields/Show_Signature_Popup__c.field-meta.xml \
  --source-dir code/main/default/objects/Producer_Placed_on_Market__c/fields/Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c.field-meta.xml \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level NoTestRun
```

**Why Better**:
- Faster deployment (2 fields vs 262 components)
- Less risk (only updates necessary fields)
- Includes both fixes: signature popup + zero values

### Phase 3: Deploy Flow Fix (NEW - NOT IN EXISTING DOCS)
❌ Existing checklist does NOT include this

**Add This Phase**:
```bash
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir code/main/default/flows/Placed_on_Market_Next_Best_Action_Mark_Weights_as_Entered.flow-meta.xml \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ProducerPomPortalSharingTest
```

### Phase 4: Activate Triggers (As Documented)
✅ Existing checklist is correct - follow as-is

### Phase 5: Verify Flows (As Documented)
✅ Existing checklist is correct - follow as-is

### Phase 6: Verify SignatureLwcHelper (As Documented)
✅ Existing checklist is correct - follow as-is

## Test Cases: Additional Testing Needed

The existing checklist has 3 test cases:
1. ✅ Normal Producer (no signature popup)
2. ✅ Director User (signature popup appears)
3. ✅ Record Sharing (users see records)

**Add Test Case 4: Zero Values Submission**
```
Profile: Producer Standard User Login
Expected: Can save with all zeros, popup appears

Steps:
1. Login as producer user
2. Navigate to Producer_Placed_on_Market__c record
3. Enter 0 for ALL category fields (1-15 Household, 1-15 Non-Household)
4. Click Save
5. Expected: Record saves successfully
6. Expected: Acknowledgement/validation popup appears
7. Expected: Status updates correctly
8. Expected: NO infinite loop
```

**Result**: ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

| ProducerPomAcknowledgeController | ❌ MISSING | ❌ MISSING | ✅ MATCH |
| Show_Signature_Popup__c | ⚠️ Outdated | ⚠️ Outdated | ✅ MATCH |
| Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c | — | ⚠️ Outdated (zero fix) | ❌ MISSING FROM DOCS |
| Weights flow | — | ⚠️ Outdated (zero fix) | ❌ MISSING FROM DOCS |
| 4 Sharing Triggers | ❌ INACTIVE | ❌ INACTIVE | ✅ MATCH |
| 2 Rollup Triggers | ❌ INACTIVE | ❌ INACTIVE | ✅ MATCH |
| SignatureLwcHelper | ✅ Deployed Oct 27 | ✅ Deployed Oct 27 | ✅ MATCH |
| Test classes | ⚠️ Different (OK) | ⚠️ Different (OK) | ✅ MATCH |
| AutoCreateProducerObligationChargeTest | — | ❌ MISSING | ❌ MISSING FROM DOCS |
| SharingHelper | — | ❌ MISSING | ❌ MISSING FROM DOCS |

**Overall Assessment**: Existing docs are 80% complete. Need to add Phase 9 zero values fixes.

## Recommendation

1. **Use existing NEWORG_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md as base** ✅
2. **Add new Phase 2.5**: Deploy Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c field fix
3. **Add new Phase 3**: Deploy Weights flow fix
4. **Add Test Case 4**: Zero values submission test
5. **Update documentation after deployment** to reflect all 9 phases

**Status**: Ready to proceed with updated plan
