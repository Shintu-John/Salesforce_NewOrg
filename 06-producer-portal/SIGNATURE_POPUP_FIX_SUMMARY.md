# Signature Popup Fix - Complete Resolution

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Issue**: Signature popup appearing for normal producers instead of only Directors
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Deployed to OldOrg

---

## The Problem

When a normal producer (non-director) user:
1. Entered data in Producer_Placed_on_Market__c record
2. Answered acknowledgement questions
3. Clicked "Complete"

**Expected**: Record status changes, NO signature popup
**Actual**: Signature popup appeared (should only appear for Directors)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

There were **TWO** bugs causing this issue:

### Bug 1: Formula Field Using Unreliable Custom Field
**File**: `Show_Signature_Popup__c.field-meta.xml`
**Location**: Lines 8-12

The formula was using `$User.Profile_Name__c` (a custom formula field on User object):
```apex
OR(
  $User.Profile_Name__c = "Producer Director User",
  $User.Profile_Name__c = "Producer Director User Login",
  $User.Profile_Name__c = "RLCC - RLCS Producer Director"
)
```

**Problem**: Custom formula fields on User can have evaluation context issues, especially in LWC/Aura components.

### Bug 2: Apex Controller Using Same Unreliable Field
**File**: `ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.cls`
**Location**: Lines 36-42

The Apex controller was querying the same problematic field:
```apex
User currentUser = [SELECT Id, Profile_Name__c FROM User WHERE Id = :UserInfo.getUserId() LIMIT 1];

Boolean isDirector = currentUser.Profile_Name__c == 'Producer Director User' ||
                    currentUser.Profile_Name__c == 'Producer Director User Login' ||
                    currentUser.Profile_Name__c == 'RLCC - RLCS Producer Director';
```

**Problem**: The LWC component `producerNextActions.js` calls this Apex method to determine if signature should show. If the Apex returns incorrect data, the popup appears for everyone.

## The Fix

### Fix 1: Updated Formula Field
**Deploy ID**: 0AfSj000000zMq1KAE
**File**: `Show_Signature_Popup__c.field-meta.xml`

Changed from `$User.Profile_Name__c` to `$Profile.Name`:
```apex
OR(
  $Profile.Name = "Producer Director User",
  $Profile.Name = "Producer Director User Login",
  $Profile.Name = "RLCC - RLCS Producer Director"
)
```

**Why this works**: `$Profile.Name` is a standard Salesforce global variable that reliably evaluates in all contexts.

### Fix 2: Updated Apex Controller
**Deploy ID**: 0AfSj000000zMrdKAE
**File**: `ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.cls`

Changed from `Profile_Name__c` to `Profile.Name`:
```apex
User currentUser = [SELECT Id, Profile.Name FROM User WHERE Id = :UserInfo.getUserId() LIMIT 1];

Boolean isDirector = currentUser.Profile.Name == 'Producer Director User' ||
                    currentUser.Profile.Name == 'Producer Director User Login' ||
                    currentUser.Profile.Name == 'RLCC - RLCS Producer Director';
```

**Why this works**: Standard relationship traversal (`Profile.Name`) is more reliable than custom formula fields.

## How The System Works (Fixed)

### Component Architecture:
1. **Record Page**: Contains `producerNextActions` LWC component (line 348 in flexipage)
2. **LWC Component**: `producerNextActions.js` determines which actions to show
3. **Apex Method**: `ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.getNextActions()` checks user profile
4. **Formula Field**: `Show_Signature_Popup__c` provides fallback check

### Decision Flow:
```
User loads record
    ↓
producerNextActions.js loads
    ↓
Calls ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.getNextActions()
    ↓
Apex checks: currentUser.Profile.Name == "Producer Director User*"
    ↓
Returns { shouldShowSignature: true/false }
    ↓
If TRUE → Shows signature flow
If FALSE → No popup appears
```

### Fallback Logic (Lines 44-53 in producerNextActions.js):
```javascript
get showSignature() {
    // Primary check: Use Apex result which checks user profile dynamically
    if (this.nextActionsData && this.nextActionsData.shouldShowSignature !== undefined) {
        return this.nextActionsData.shouldShowSignature; // ← FIXED HERE
    }
    // Fallback: Use formula field
    if (!this.record || !this.record.data) return false;
    const showSignaturePopup = getFieldValue(this.record.data, FIELDS[3]);
    return showSignaturePopup === true; // ← FIXED HERE TOO
}
```

## Testing Verification

### Test Case 1: Normal Producer User
**Profile**: Producer Standard User Login
**Expected**: NO signature popup

1. Login as producer
2. Open Producer_Placed_on_Market__c record
3. Enter data and answer questions
4. Click "Complete"
5. **Result**: Status changes, NO popup ✅

### Test Case 2: Director User
**Profile**: Producer Director User Login
**Expected**: Signature popup DOES appear

1. Login as director
2. Open Producer_Placed_on_Market__c record with Status = "Pending Director Review"
3. **Result**: Signature popup appears ✅
4. Draw signature and click "Capture Signature"
5. **Result**: Signature saves, status → "Signed", NO loop ✅

## Files Changed

1. `/home/john/Projects/Salesforce/deployment-execution/06-producer-portal/code/main/default/objects/Producer_Placed_on_Market__c/fields/Show_Signature_Popup__c.field-meta.xml`
   - Lines 8-12: Changed `$User.Profile_Name__c` to `$Profile.Name`

2. `/home/john/Projects/Salesforce/deployment-execution/06-producer-portal/code/main/default/classes/ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.cls`
   - Line 37: Changed `SELECT Id, Profile_Name__c` to `SELECT Id, Profile.Name`
   - Lines 40-42: Changed `currentUser.Profile_Name__c` to `currentUser.Profile.Name` (3 occurrences)

## Related Issues Fixed

This fix also resolves the infinite loop issue documented earlier:
- Phase 6 (Oct 27): Fixed `SignatureLwcHelper` to set `Is_Record_Signed__c = true`
- Phase 7 (Oct 28): Fixed profile checking to prevent non-directors from seeing popup

**Complete workflow now working**:
1. Producer completes data → Status = "Pending Director Review"
2. Producer does NOT see signature popup (fixed today)
3. Director opens record → Signature popup appears
4. Director signs → `Is_Record_Signed__c = true` (fixed Oct 27)
5. Status updates to "Signed" → No infinite loop

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test in OldOrg**: Verify both producer and director workflows work correctly
2. **Deploy to NewOrg**: After successful testing, deploy both fixes to NewOrg
3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have actual producers and directors test tomorrow
