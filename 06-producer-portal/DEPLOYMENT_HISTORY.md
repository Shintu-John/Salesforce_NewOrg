- Producer_POM_Acknowledge_Feedback.flow - Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003nkBFKAQ
- Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow - Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003njqHKAQ

**Manual Steps Required:**
- ✅ Activated both flows manually in UI (flows deploy as Inactive in production)

### Phase 4: Flow Activation - Producer Portal Flows (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (morning)
**Deploy IDs:**
- `0AfSj000000zLfRKAU` - validationQuestionsFlow
- `0AfSj000000zLltKAE` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Question_Best_Action
- `0AfSj000000zLnVKAU` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Resubmission_Best_Action
- `0AfSj000000zLp7KAE` - Allowed_Resubmission_of_POMD
- `0AfSj000000zLqjKAU` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Signature_Best_Action

**Components Activated:**
- validationQuestionsFlow
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Question_Best_Action
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Resubmission_Best_Action
- Allowed_Resubmission_of_POMD
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Signature_Best_Action

**Issue Resolved:** Flows were in Draft status, preventing them from appearing in Permission Set Flow Access list

### Phase 5: Missing Signature LWC Components (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (afternoon)
**Deploy IDs:**
- `0AfSj000000zLqjKAU` - captureSignature LWC component
- `0AfSj000000zLsLKAM` - SignatureLwcHelper Apex class

**Components Deployed:**
- captureSignature Lightning Web Component (signature canvas functionality)
- SignatureLwcHelper.cls (signature document storage)
- SignatureLwcHelperTest.cls (test class)

**Issue Resolved:** Director signature capture was failing because the LWC component and Apex class were missing from deployment

### Phase 6: Signature Status Update Fix (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (late afternoon)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSj000000zMDJKA2`
**Duration:** 4m 0.23s

**Components Updated:**
- SignatureLwcHelper.cls (added Is_Record_Signed__c field update)

**Issue Resolved:** Infinite loop causing signature popup to reappear after capture

**Root Cause:**
- SignatureLwcHelper was saving signature document but NOT setting `Is_Record_Signed__c = true`
- Producer_POM_Update_Status flow checks `Is_Record_Signed__c` to update status to "Signed"
- Without this field being set, status remained "Pending Director Review"
- Flow re-launched signature screen because status didn't change

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Mark record as signed to trigger status update flow (for Producer_Placed_on_Market__c only)
if(sObjectType == Schema.Producer_Placed_on_Market__c.SObjectType){
    record.put('Is_Record_Signed__c', true);
}
```

**Test Results:** SignatureLwcHelperTest passed with 100% coverage

### Phase 7: Signature Popup Visibility Fix (Oct 28, 2025)
**Date:** October 28, 2025 (morning)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSj000000zMq1KAE` (OldOrg only)
**Duration:** ~2 minutes

**Components Updated:**
- Show_Signature_Popup__c formula field on Producer_Placed_on_Market__c

**Issue Resolved:** Signature popup appearing for normal producers instead of only Directors

**Root Cause:**
- Formula field used `$User.Profile_Name__c` (custom formula field on User)
- Formula fields on User object can have evaluation context issues
- Normal producers were seeing signature popup when they shouldn't

**Fix Applied:**
Changed formula from:
```apex
$User.Profile_Name__c = "Producer Director User"
```
To:
```apex
$Profile.Name = "Producer Director User"
```

**Full Fixed Formula:**
```apex
AND(
  Show_Acknowledgement_PopUp__c = FALSE,
  Show_Popup_For_Validation_Question__c = FALSE,
  ISPICKVAL(Status__c, "Pending Director Review"),
  OR(
    $Profile.Name = "Producer Director User",
    $Profile.Name = "Producer Director User Login",
    $Profile.Name = "RLCC - RLCS Producer Director"
  )
)
```

**Impact:** Normal producers will no longer see signature popup. Only Director profiles will see it.

**Testing Required:**
- Test with Producer Standard User Login → Should NOT see signature popup
- Test with Producer Director User Login → Should see signature popup
- Verify status update flow still works correctly

**NewOrg Status:** Pending deployment after OldOrg testing completes

### Phase 9: Zero Values Popup Not Showing Fix (Oct 28, 2025)
**Date:** October 28, 2025 (afternoon)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSj000000zO5RKAU` (OldOrg only)
**Duration:** ~9 seconds

**Components Updated:**
- Placed_on_Market_Next_Best_Action_Mark_Weights_as_Entered.flow-meta.xml

**Issue Resolved:** Acknowledgement popup not showing when users enter all zero values for categories

**Root Cause:**
- Flow had two decision branches:
  1. Set Weights_Entered__c = true IF (Household Total > 0 OR Non-Household Total > 0) AND Weights_Entered__c = false
  2. Set Weights_Entered__c = false IF Weights_Entered__c = true AND both totals = 0
- When user entered all zeros, totals = 0, so branch #1 didn't execute
- Even worse, branch #2 would reset Weights_Entered__c back to false if it was previously true
- Show_Acknowledgement_PopUp__c formula requires Weights_Entered__c = true to display popup
- Result: No popup displayed even though user had entered data

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the > 0 condition checks from the flow
- Simplified logic to: Set Weights_Entered__c = true whenever it's currently false (on any save)
- Removed the branch that resets Weights_Entered__c back to false
- Now any data entry (including all zeros) will set the flag and trigger the popup

**Updated Flow Logic:**
```xml
<conditions>
    <leftValueReference>$Record.Weights_Entered__c</leftValueReference>
    <operator>EqualTo</operator>
    <rightValue>
        <booleanValue>false</booleanValue>
    </rightValue>
</conditions>
```

**Test Results:** ProducerPomPortalSharingTest passed with 100% coverage

**Business Impact:** Producers can now legitimately submit quarterly reports with all zero values (when they have no activity for that quarter) and still see the acknowledgement popup

**NewOrg Status:** Pending deployment after OldOrg testing completes

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Flow Visibility in Permission Sets (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** Producer portal flows not appearing in Permission Set Flow Access list

**Root Cause:** Flows were in Draft status. Salesforce only shows Active flows with `isAdditionalPermissionRequiredToRun=true` in permission set UI.

**Fix:** Changed status from Draft to Active for all producer portal flows and deployed them successfully.

**User Feedback:** User explicitly requested: "okay, in that case please continue and deploy all the flows that are required to work with the producer portal as active"

### Issue 2: Signature Capture Not Functioning (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** User reported: "when he uses mouse and draws his signature and clicks on Capture Signature, it just refreshes the page and does not save it or change the status"

**Root Cause:** The `captureSignature` LWC component was missing from deployment.

**Fix:** Retrieved component from production and deployed it (Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zLqjKAU). Also retrieved and deployed the `SignatureLwcHelper` Apex class (Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zLsLKAM).

### Issue 3: Infinite Loop - Signature Popup Keeps Appearing (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** User reported: "now when the director add the signatue and clicks on capture signature, it just refreshed the page and that brings up the signature capture pop-up again"

**Root Cause:** The signature was saving successfully, but `Is_Record_Signed__c` checkbox field wasn't being set to true. The `Producer POM - Update Status` flow checks this field, and when false, keeps the status as "Pending Director Review", causing the signature flow to launch again after redirect.

**Fix:** Updated `SignatureLwcHelper.cls` to set `Is_Record_Signed__c = true` when saving signatures for Producer_Placed_on_Market__c records.

**User Feedback:** User suggested checking "Producer POM - Update Status" flow, which led to discovering the root cause.

**Deployment Strategy:** Changed from RunLocalTests (1147 tests) to RunSpecifiedTests with SignatureLwcHelperTest to reduce deployment time.

### Issue 4: Test Failure - Invalid Field for User Object (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** Deployment failed with error: "System.SObjectException: Invalid field Is_Record_Signed__c for User"

**Root Cause:** The updated code was setting `Is_Record_Signed__c` on all record types, but the test class used a User object which doesn't have this field.

**Fix:** Added conditional check to only set `Is_Record_Signed__c` when the record type is `Producer_Placed_on_Market__c`:
```apex
if(sObjectType == Schema.Producer_Placed_on_Market__c.SObjectType){
    record.put('Is_Record_Signed__c', true);
}
```

**Final Deployment:** Successfully deployed with Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zMDJKA2, test passed with 100% coverage.

### Issue 5: Acknowledgement Popup Not Showing for Zero Values (Oct 28)
**Symptom:** User reported: "when user entered 0 in one category and clicked on save, it saved - but did not trigger the pop-up with the acknowledgement or validation questions"

**Root Cause:** The "Placed on Market: Next Best Action - Mark Weights as Entered" flow only set `Weights_Entered__c = true` if either household or non-household total was greater than 0. When all category values were 0, both totals equaled 0, so the flag wasn't set. Additionally, a second branch in the flow would reset the flag back to false if both totals were 0.

**Fix:** Modified flow to set `Weights_Entered__c = true` on any save operation where it's currently false, regardless of the actual values entered. Removed the branch that resets the flag to false. The Force_Positive_Value validation rule already prevents negative values.

**Deployment:** Deploy ID 0AfSj000000zO5RKAU, test passed with 100% coverage using ProducerPomPortalSharingTest.

## Test Fixes Applied (Phase 1 - Oct 24)

### Critical Issues Resolved

Fixed 9 failing tests (converted from 11/9 pass/fail to 20/20 passing). All failures were due to Flow validation and data setup issues specific to NewOrg.

#### Issue 1: Flow Validation - Missing Contract Obligation Type
**Error:** "Please ensure you have uploaded all the relevant (4 Quarter) on market data for [year] with Acknowledgement of Statements"

**Root Cause:**
- Contract.Obligation_Type__c was NULL
- Flow validates POM Record_Type_Name__c must equal Contract.Obligation_Type__c
- POM RecordType was 'Household' instead of 'Non_Household'
- Missing Acknowledgement_of_Statements__c = true
- Only 14 categories filled instead of all 30

**Tests Fixed:** 5 tests (all Obligation sharing tests)

#### Issue 2: Duplication Validation Error
**Error:** "You can can not create duplication records"

**Root Cause:**
- Flow enforces uniqueness on Account + Quarter + Compliance_Year + RecordTypeId
- Bulk insert triggering Flow duplication detection

**Tests Fixed:** 3 tests (UserSharingBackfillHelper tests)

#### Issue 3: Flow Activation - Missing Picklist Values
**Error:** "bad value for restricted picklist field: Ready to Acknowledge"

**Fix:** Created Status__c field with 6 required picklist values

#### Issue 4: Governor Limit - Too Many SOQL Queries
**Error:** "System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101"

**Fix:** Moved POM creation inside Test.startTest() block

## Architecture Understanding: Signature Workflow

The Producer Portal signature workflow involves:

1. **Flow Launch**: When status = "Pending Director Review", signature flow launches
2. **Signature Capture Screen**: Flow shows signature capture screen with `captureSignature` LWC component
3. **Component Action**: User draws signature and clicks "Capture Signature"
4. **Apex Call**: Component calls `SignatureLwcHelper.saveSignature()` Apex method
5. **Document Storage**: Apex saves signature as Document and updates record:
   - Sets `Director_Signature_Doc_Id__c` with Document ID
   - Sets `Is_Record_Signed__c = true` (CRITICAL for status update)
6. **Status Update Trigger**: Record update triggers `Producer POM - Update Status` flow
7. **Status Change**: Flow checks `Is_Record_Signed__c = true`, sets status to "Signed"
8. **Flow Navigation**: Flow redirects to record page
9. **Workflow Complete**: Signature flow doesn't launch because status is now "Signed"

**Key Dependencies:**
- [captureSignature.js:84-129](code/main/default/lwc/captureSignature/captureSignature.js#L84-L129) - Signature canvas and save logic
- [SignatureLwcHelper.cls:16-25](code/classes/SignatureLwcHelper.cls#L16-L25) - Document storage and field updates
- [Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow:15-27](code/main/default/unpackaged/flows/Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow#L15-L27) - Status update decision logic

## NewOrg Deployment (October 28, 2025)

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING - Code deployed, manual trigger activation required
**Business Impact**: £1.5M+ annual compliance fees at risk until completion

### Phase 1: ProducerPomAcknowledgeController (Oct 28, 2025)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSq000003p5iHKAQ`
**Duration:** ~30s
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

**Components Deployed:**
- ProducerPomAcknowledgeController.cls
- ProducerPomAcknowledgeControllerTest.cls (with comp_house__Company_Number__c fix)

**Test Results:** 3/3 passing (100% coverage)

**Challenges:**
- OldOrg test class didn't include `comp_house__Company_Number__c` field
- NewOrg has validation rule requiring this field (not present in OldOrg)
- Fixed by adding `comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678'` to all test Account records
- Also required all Category 1-15 Household and Non-Household fields populated

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
Account acc = new Account(
    Name = 'Test Account',
    comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678'
);

Producer_Placed_on_Market__c pom = new Producer_Placed_on_Market__c(
    Account__c = acc.Id,
    // ... other fields
    Category_1_Household__c = 100,
    Category_2_Household__c = 100,
    // ... through Category_15_Household__c
    Category_1_Non_Household__c = 100,
    // ... through Category_15_Non_Household__c
);
```

### Phase 2: Formula Field Fixes (Oct 28, 2025)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSq000003p5NJKAY`
**Duration:** ~25s
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

**Components Deployed:**
- Show_Signature_Popup__c.field-meta.xml (fixed formula)
- Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c.field-meta.xml (ISBLANK to ISNULL)

**Test Results:** ProducerPomPortalSharingTest passed

**Changes:**
1. **Show_Signature_Popup__c**: Changed from `$User.Profile_Name__c` to `$Profile.Name`
2. **Is_Ready_To_Acknowledge__c**: Changed from ISBLANK() to ISNULL() for zero values handling

---

### Phase 3: Flow Fix - Zero Values (Oct 28, 2025)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSq000003p5jtKAA`
**Duration:** ~20s
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

**Components Deployed:**
- Placed_on_Market_Next_Best_Action_Mark_Weights_as_Entered.flow-meta.xml

**Purpose:** Allows producers to submit quarterly reports with all zero values

---

### Phase 4: Sharing Triggers - PENDING MANUAL ACTIVATION
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSq000003p6hZKAQ` (code deployed, triggers remain Inactive)
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Requires Manual UI Activation

**Components Deployed:**
- ProducerContractSharingTrigger.trigger (code only)
- ProducerObligationSharingTrigger.trigger (code only)
- ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger.trigger (code only)
- UserSharingBackfill.trigger (code only)
- ProducerSharingHelper.cls (updated with comp_house__Company_Number__c fix)
- ProducerSharingHelperTest.cls (updated)
- UserSharingBackfillHelper.cls
- UserSharingBackfillHelperTest.cls (updated with comp_house__Company_Number__c fix)

**Critical Finding:** Salesforce **DOES NOT** allow trigger activation via metadata deployment in production orgs. All triggers remain Inactive even though metadata files have `<status>Active</status>`.

**Attempts Made:**
1. ❌ Tooling API Update: `insufficient access rights on cross-reference id`
2. ❌ Metadata Deployment: Status changes silently ignored in production
3. ❌ CLI Commands: No CLI command exists for trigger activation

**Test Fixes Applied:**
```apex
// ProducerSharingHelperTest.cls - Line 9-16
private static Account makeAccount(String name) {
    Account a = new Account(
        Name = name,
        comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678'
    );
    insert a;
    return a;
}

// UserSharingBackfillHelperTest.cls
Account acc = new Account(
    Name = 'Test Producer Company', 
    comp_house__Company_Number__c = '12345678'
);
```

**Current Status Verified:**
```
ProducerContractSharingTrigger       → Inactive
ProducerObligationSharingTrigger     → Inactive
ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger → Inactive
UserSharingBackfill                  → Inactive
```

**🚨 REQUIRED MANUAL STEPS:**

1. **Login to NewOrg:** https://recyclinglives-services.my.salesforce.com
2. **Navigate:** Setup → Apex Triggers
3. **Activate Each Trigger:**
   - Click trigger name → Edit → Change Status to "Active" → Save
   - Repeat for all 4 triggers

4. **Verify Activation:**
```bash
sf data query \
  --query "SELECT Name, Status FROM ApexTrigger WHERE Name IN ('ProducerContractSharingTrigger', 'ProducerObligationSharingTrigger', 'ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger', 'UserSharingBackfill') ORDER BY Name" \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --use-tooling-api
```

**Why Manual Activation is Required:**
- Salesforce production org governance requirement
- Safety measure to prevent accidental trigger activation
- Audit trail and compliance requirement
- By design - cannot be bypassed programmatically

**Business Impact of Inactive Triggers:**
- ❌ Producer Portal **COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL** in NewOrg
- ❌ Login license users cannot see ANY producer records
- ❌ Sharing records not created for Contracts, Obligations, or POM records
- 💰 £1.5M+ annual compliance fees at risk

---

### Phase 5: Flow Verification - PENDING
**Status:** ⏳ Awaiting verification after trigger activation

**Flows to Verify (Active Status):**
1. Producer_Placed_On_Market_Acknowledge_Best_Action
2. Producer_Placed_On_Market_Signature_Best_Action
3. Producer_Placed_On_Market_Question_Best_Action
4. Producer_Placed_On_Market_Resubmission_Best_Action
5. Allowed_Resubmission_of_POMD
6. Placed_on_Market_Next_Best_Action_Mark_Weights_as_Entered

**Verification Steps:**
1. Setup → Flows
2. Search for each flow name
3. Verify Status = "Active"
4. If any are "Draft", click Activate

## Key Learnings - NewOrg Deployment

### Environment Differences
1. **Validation Rules:** NewOrg has `comp_house__Company_Number__c` validation that doesn't exist in OldOrg
2. **Test Data Requirements:** OldOrg tests don't populate fields required by NewOrg validation rules
3. **Category Fields:** NewOrg validation requires all Category 1-15 fields populated

### Salesforce Production Org Constraints
1. **Trigger Activation:** CANNOT be done via API, CLI, or metadata deployment
2. **Manual UI Required:** Only method for activating triggers in production
3. **Test Coverage:** 75% minimum required for all deployments
4. **Security Model:** "insufficient access rights" prevents programmatic trigger status changes

### Deployment Strategy Insights
1. **Test Class Fixes:** Must be adapted for target org's validation rules
2. **RunSpecifiedTests:** More reliable than RunLocalTests for targeted deployments
3. **Environment Analysis:** Always compare validation rules between orgs before deployment
4. **Metadata Limitations:** Some Salesforce features require manual configuration in production
