**Deploy IDs:** `0AfSq000003nk9dKAA`, `0AfSq000003nkBFKAQ`, `0AfSq000003njqHKAQ`
**Duration:** ~3 minutes total

**Components Deployed:**

- Producer_POM_Acknowledge_Feedback.flow - Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003nkBFKAQ
- Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow - Deploy ID: 0AfSq000003njqHKAQ

**Manual Steps Required:**
- ✅ Activated both flows manually in UI (flows deploy as Inactive in production)

### Phase 4: Flow Activation - Producer Portal Flows (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (morning)
**Deploy IDs:**
- `0AfSj000000zLfRKAU` - validationQuestionsFlow
- `0AfSj000000zLltKAE` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Question_Best_Action
- `0AfSj000000zLnVKAU` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Resubmission_Best_Action
- `0AfSj000000zLp7KAE` - Allowed_Resubmission_of_POMD
- `0AfSj000000zLqjKAU` - Producer_Placed_On_Market_Signature_Best_Action

**Components Activated:**
- validationQuestionsFlow
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Question_Best_Action
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Resubmission_Best_Action
- Allowed_Resubmission_of_POMD
- Producer_Placed_On_Market_Signature_Best_Action

**Issue Resolved:** Flows were in Draft status, preventing them from appearing in Permission Set Flow Access list

### Phase 5: Missing Signature LWC Components (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (afternoon)
**Deploy IDs:**
- `0AfSj000000zLqjKAU` - captureSignature LWC component
- `0AfSj000000zLsLKAM` - SignatureLwcHelper Apex class

**Components Deployed:**
- captureSignature Lightning Web Component (signature canvas functionality)
- SignatureLwcHelper.cls (signature document storage)
- SignatureLwcHelperTest.cls (test class)

**Issue Resolved:** Director signature capture was failing because the LWC component and Apex class were missing from deployment

### Phase 6: Signature Status Update Fix (Oct 27, 2025)
**Date:** October 27, 2025 (late afternoon)
**Deploy ID:** `0AfSj000000zMDJKAM`
**Duration:** 4m 0.23s

**Components Updated:**
- SignatureLwcHelper.cls (added Is_Record_Signed__c field update)

**Issue Resolved:** Infinite loop causing signature popup to reappear after capture

**Root Cause:**
- SignatureLwcHelper was saving signature document but NOT setting `Is_Record_Signed__c = true`
- Producer_POM_Update_Status flow checks `Is_Record_Signed__c` to update status to "Signed"
- Without this field being set, status remained "Pending Director Review"
- Flow re-launched signature screen because status didn't change

**Fix Applied:**
```apex
// Mark record as signed to trigger status update flow (for Producer_Placed_on_Market__c only)
if(sObjectType == Schema.Producer_Placed_on_Market__c.SObjectType){
    record.put('Is_Record_Signed__c', true);
}
```

**Test Results:** SignatureLwcHelperTest passed with 100% coverage

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Flow Visibility in Permission Sets (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** Producer portal flows not appearing in Permission Set Flow Access list

**Root Cause:** Flows were in Draft status. Salesforce only shows Active flows with `isAdditionalPermissionRequiredToRun=true` in permission set UI.

**Fix:** Changed status from Draft to Active for all producer portal flows and deployed them successfully.

**User Feedback:** User explicitly requested: "okay, in that case please continue and deploy all the flows that are required to work with the producer portal as active"

### Issue 2: Signature Capture Not Functioning (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** User reported: "when he uses mouse and draws his signature and clicks on Capture Signature, it just refreshes the page and does not save it or change the status"

**Root Cause:** The `captureSignature` LWC component was missing from deployment.

**Fix:** Retrieved component from production and deployed it (Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zLqjKAU). Also retrieved and deployed the `SignatureLwcHelper` Apex class (Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zLsLKAM).

### Issue 3: Infinite Loop - Signature Popup Keeps Appearing (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** User reported: "now when the director add the signatue and clicks on capture signature, it just refreshed the page and that brings up the signature capture pop-up again"

**Root Cause:** The signature was saving successfully, but `Is_Record_Signed__c` checkbox field wasn't being set to true. The `Producer POM - Update Status` flow checks this field, and when false, keeps the status as "Pending Director Review", causing the signature flow to launch again after redirect.

**Fix:** Updated `SignatureLwcHelper.cls` to set `Is_Record_Signed__c = true` when saving signatures for Producer_Placed_on_Market__c records.

**User Feedback:** User suggested checking "Producer POM - Update Status" flow, which led to discovering the root cause.

**Deployment Strategy:** Changed from RunLocalTests (1147 tests) to RunSpecifiedTests with SignatureLwcHelperTest to reduce deployment time.

### Issue 4: Test Failure - Invalid Field for User Object (Oct 27)
**Symptom:** Deployment failed with error: "System.SObjectException: Invalid field Is_Record_Signed__c for User"

**Root Cause:** The updated code was setting `Is_Record_Signed__c` on all record types, but the test class used a User object which doesn't have this field.

**Fix:** Added conditional check to only set `Is_Record_Signed__c` when the record type is `Producer_Placed_on_Market__c`:
```apex
if(sObjectType == Schema.Producer_Placed_on_Market__c.SObjectType){
    record.put('Is_Record_Signed__c', true);
}
```

**Final Deployment:** Successfully deployed with Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000zMDJKA2, test passed with 100% coverage.

## Test Fixes Applied (Phase 1 - Oct 24)

### Critical Issues Resolved

Fixed 9 failing tests (converted from 11/9 pass/fail to 20/20 passing). All failures were due to Flow validation and data setup issues specific to NewOrg.

#### Issue 1: Flow Validation - Missing Contract Obligation Type
**Error:** "Please ensure you have uploaded all the relevant (4 Quarter) on market data for [year] with Acknowledgement of Statements"

**Root Cause:**
- Contract.Obligation_Type__c was NULL
- Flow validates POM Record_Type_Name__c must equal Contract.Obligation_Type__c
- POM RecordType was 'Household' instead of 'Non_Household'
- Missing Acknowledgement_of_Statements__c = true
- Only 14 categories filled instead of all 30

**Tests Fixed:** 5 tests (all Obligation sharing tests)

#### Issue 2: Duplication Validation Error
**Error:** "You can can not create duplication records"

**Root Cause:**
- Flow enforces uniqueness on Account + Quarter + Compliance_Year + RecordTypeId
- Bulk insert triggering Flow duplication detection

**Tests Fixed:** 3 tests (UserSharingBackfillHelper tests)

#### Issue 3: Flow Activation - Missing Picklist Values
**Error:** "bad value for restricted picklist field: Ready to Acknowledge"

**Fix:** Created Status__c field with 6 required picklist values

#### Issue 4: Governor Limit - Too Many SOQL Queries
**Error:** "System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101"

**Fix:** Moved POM creation inside Test.startTest() block

## Architecture Understanding: Signature Workflow

The Producer Portal signature workflow involves:

1. **Flow Launch**: When status = "Pending Director Review", signature flow launches
2. **Signature Capture Screen**: Flow shows signature capture screen with `captureSignature` LWC component
3. **Component Action**: User draws signature and clicks "Capture Signature"
4. **Apex Call**: Component calls `SignatureLwcHelper.saveSignature()` Apex method
5. **Document Storage**: Apex saves signature as Document and updates record:
   - Sets `Director_Signature_Doc_Id__c` with Document ID
   - Sets `Is_Record_Signed__c = true` (CRITICAL for status update)
6. **Status Update Trigger**: Record update triggers `Producer POM - Update Status` flow
7. **Status Change**: Flow checks `Is_Record_Signed__c = true`, sets status to "Signed"
8. **Flow Navigation**: Flow redirects to record page
9. **Workflow Complete**: Signature flow doesn't launch because status is now "Signed"

**Key Dependencies:**
- [captureSignature.js:84-129](code/main/default/lwc/captureSignature/captureSignature.js#L84-L129) - Signature canvas and save logic
- [SignatureLwcHelper.cls:16-25](code/classes/SignatureLwcHelper.cls#L16-L25) - Document storage and field updates
- [Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow:15-27](code/main/default/unpackaged/flows/Producer_POM_Update_Status.flow#L15-L27) - Status update decision logic
