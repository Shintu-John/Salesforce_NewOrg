## Test Fixes Applied

### Critical Issues Resolved

Fixed 9 failing tests (converted from 11/9 pass/fail to 20/20 passing). All failures were due to Flow validation and data setup issues specific to NewOrg.

#### Issue 1: Flow Validation - Missing Contract Obligation Type
**Error:** "Please ensure you have uploaded all the relevant (4 Quarter) on market data for [year] with Acknowledgement of Statements"

**Root Cause:**
- Contract.Obligation_Type__c was NULL
- Flow validates POM Record_Type_Name__c must equal Contract.Obligation_Type__c
- POM RecordType was 'Household' instead of 'Non_Household'
- Missing Acknowledgement_of_Statements__c = true
- Only 14 categories filled instead of all 30

**Tests Fixed:** 5 tests (all Obligation sharing tests)

#### Issue 2: Duplication Validation Error
**Error:** "You can can not create duplication records"

**Root Cause:**
- Flow enforces uniqueness on Account + Quarter + Compliance_Year + RecordTypeId
- Bulk insert triggering Flow duplication detection

**Tests Fixed:** 3 tests (UserSharingBackfillHelper tests)

#### Issue 3: Flow Activation - Missing Picklist Values
**Error:** "bad value for restricted picklist field: Ready to Acknowledge"

**Fix:** Created Status__c field with 6 required picklist values

#### Issue 4: Governor Limit - Too Many SOQL Queries
**Error:** "System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries: 101"

**Fix:** Moved POM creation inside Test.startTest() block
