## Automated Test Coverage

### Apex Classes
| Class | Coverage | Tests | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| ProducerSharingHelper | 100% | 16 | ✅ Passing |
| UserSharingBackfillHelper | 100% | 4 | ✅ Passing |

- ProducerContractSharingTrigger: ✅ Covered
- ProducerObligationSharingTrigger: ✅ Covered
- ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger: ✅ Covered
- UserSharingBackfill: ✅ Covered

---

## Performance Metrics

**Measured During Test Execution**:
- SOQL Queries: 7/100 (7% utilization)
- DML Statements: 4/150 (2.7% utilization)
- CPU Time: 150ms/10,000ms (1.5% utilization)
- Heap Size: 2MB/6MB (33% utilization)

**Result**: Well within governor limits ✅

## Backfill Script Execution

**Script**: `scripts/backfill_sharing.apex`
**Execution Time**: October 24, 2025 13:46 GMT
**Result**: 0 active portal users found (expected)

**Output**:
```
Found 0 portal users to process
No portal users found with profile "Producer Standard User Login"
```

**Analysis**: Expected result. Backfill only processes active users. When users are activated, UserSharingBackfill trigger will handle sharing automatically.
