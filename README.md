- **‚ö†Ô∏è Manual UI Steps**: Step-by-step UI instructions with screenshots/verification

‚úÖ **Pre-Deployment Verification**
- Environment checks before deployment
- Prerequisite validation
- Data backup recommendations

‚úÖ **Professional Documentation Standards**
- ALWAYS use README.md (never DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md or GAP_ANALYSIS.md)
- No AI references in commits or documentation
- Working GitHub links to OldOrg State documentation
- Clear rollback procedures

‚úÖ **Verified Deployment-Ready Code**
- Code verified line-by-line against OldOrg

## Deployment Step Standards

### ‚úÖ CLI Steps (Automated)

Each CLI step includes:
- **Exact command** ready to copy/paste
- **Expected output** (what success looks like)
- **Verification query** (confirm deployment)
- **Error handling** (what to do if it fails)

Example:
```bash
# Step 1.1: Deploy Apex Class
sf project deploy start \
  --source-dir "scenario-name/code/classes/ClassName.cls" \
  --target-org NewOrg \
  --test-level RunSpecifiedTests \
  --tests ClassNameTest \
  --wait 10

# Verification:
sf data query --query "SELECT Name, Status FROM ApexClass WHERE Name = 'ClassName'" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual UI Steps (User Performs)

Each manual step includes:
- **Why manual**: Explanation of why CLI can't handle this
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Navigate to X > Click Y > Enter Z
- **Screenshots/Details**: Visual or detailed description
- **Verification query**: Confirm configuration via CLI

Example:
```
Step 2.1: Activate Flow (‚ö†Ô∏è Manual UI Step)

Why Manual: Flows always deploy as Inactive. Must be manually activated.

Instructions:
1. Navigate to: Setup > Flows > [Flow Name]
2. Click "Activate"
3. Confirm activation

Verification:
sf data query --query "SELECT Definition.DeveloperName, Status FROM Flow WHERE Definition.DeveloperName = 'FlowName' AND Status = 'Active'" --target-org NewOrg --use-tooling-api
```
